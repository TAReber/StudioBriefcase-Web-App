        <p>
            You are here because you dream of a project. There is nothing like it in the world, so there is no template that will tell
            you how to make it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Often, advice given by others will be misleading. Lets say you want to make your own Game Engine and you start
            learning C++. Someone will tell you technically you can do it all with just knowing C++ code. They aren't wrong. But you can't do it with just
            knowing C++ because you don't have enough hours in your life time to recreate everything with C++.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reality is, C++, any single language or framework is just one piece of a massive puzzle your trying to assemble. Programming is knowing
            how to take all these different pieces and use them to assemble whats in your mind. The goal of this site is to show you what puzzles pieces
            you have to work with and how they work with eachother.

                        The purpose for creating this site was to help others find their potential. The tech industry is hundreds of frameworks with millions of
                        man hours to make them. Entire careers are built around them and it is no easy task.

                    <p>
                        What matters to me is time. The number of hours spent being dumb and confused is something I seek remove from the learning curve.
                        If a hundred hours of my work can save many people ten hours of their life, or even prevent one person from losing motivation,
                        them it was worth my effort and time.

                        Reading through the documentation that exists for any framework is a monumental task. These documents are usually written in a language
                        that adopts acedemic standard and abstracts terminology that mean nothing outside the target framework. The information is difficult
                        to dissect, difficult to digest, if not mind numbingly boring to read.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to understand a framework, you need to think the same way the people who created it think. What makes it more difficult,
                        these frameworks and systems often rely on one another to solve one kind of problem. Learning to build this website using
                        ASP.NET Core launched myself into a rabbit hole filled with documents. I started learning a framework that uses high level of
                        abstraction that depends on other framework like html, css, bootstrap, javascript, sql, c# to make a final product. It caused
                        me pain and left me feeling like a nincompoop on many occasions.

                        My tutorials focus' on a few goals intended to make learning as pain free as possible.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Introduction to what a framework is for and the structure of how it solves that problem.</li>
                            <li>Introduction to the nomenclature used in official documentation to assist in learning how to find and research information in external sources.</li>
                            <li>Introduction to frameworks features and how they are used.</li>
                            <li>Introduction to how its used with other frameworks, ranging from build environments, to languages, to frameworks.</li>
                            <li>To present documented information at the right time in the right way.</li>
                            <li>Most importantly, to make sure you are aware of the things you don't yet know exist but need to know.</li>

                        The tutorials on this site are not intended replace any official Documentation. Its purpose is to provide a simplified introduction
                        to conventions, design and structure so a person can engage and research official documentation easier.

                        What is said and what is not said these tutorials is done because I believe that some things in the official documentation
                        have a better time and place to be talked about in detail. The goal is to show people where the base of the mountain is so
                        they know where and how to start climbing from.
