    </div>

    <div class="mt-5">
        <p>Many Vulkan Objects are immutable, meaning they never change. These objects are not externally 
            synchronized because they can only be read from. Some object contain parameters that do change 
            the objects, we need to make sure that multiple host threads don’t change the object at the 
            same time. Vulkan contains a list of parameters that need to be Externally Synchronized.
        </p>
        <p>
            Types of Externally Synchronized Parameters: Destroying Objects, managing memory, way events, 
            Draw calls, Parameters lists. To know if a parameter needs to be Externally Synchronized, 
            refer the documentation. Parameters marked const are not reliable to determine if it’s a 
            Externally Synchronized parameter.
